```

## Setup Instructions

### For Users

1. **Apply migration**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\apply-email-migration.ps1
   ```

2. **Configure .env**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_ENABLED=true
   EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@outlook.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   EMAIL_ALLOWED_SENDERS=noreply@x.ai
   ```

3. **Get Outlook app password**:
   - Visit https://account.microsoft.com/security
   - Create app-specific password
   - Use in EMAIL_PASSWORD

4. **Restart application**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\restart-with-fmp.ps1
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Run migration**:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\apply-email-migration.ps1
   ```

3. **Test email service**:
   ```go
   // Connection test happens automatically on startup
   // Check logs for "Email connection test successful"
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] IMAP connection to Outlook
- [x] Email fetching with sender filtering
- [x] Email deduplication via message_id
- [x] Email to article conversion
- [x] Database storage and retrieval
- [x] Error handling and retry logic
- [x] Integration with AI processing
- [x] Graceful shutdown
- [ ] End-to-end test with real email (requires user credentials)

## Known Limitations

1. **Body Parsing**: Currently uses type assertion for body section parsing. The go-imap v2 API returns `FetchBodySectionBuffer` which needs proper handling. Works but could be more elegant.

2. **Single Account**: Only supports one email account per instance. Multiple accounts would require multiple processor instances.

3. **No Attachment Support**: Currently only processes text/HTML bodies. Attachments are ignored.

4. **No Folder Selection**: Only processes INBOX. Other folders are not supported.

5. **Memory**: Fetches all unread emails in one batch. May need pagination for high-volume scenarios.

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] API endpoints for email management
- [ ] Email statistics dashboard
- [ ] Manual reprocessing trigger
- [ ] Better error categorization

### Long Term
- [ ] Multiple email account support
- [ ] Folder filtering support
- [ ] Attachment extraction and storage
- [ ] Email threading (replies, forwards)
- [ ] Webhook notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering rules engine
- [ ] Real-time push notifications (IDLE)
- [ ] Email template parsing per sender

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Polling**: Every 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Connection**: Created per cycle, not persistent
- **Batch Size**: Processes all unread emails
- **AI Processing**: Asynchronous, doesn't block

### Recommendations
- Keep polling interval at 5-15 minutes for most use cases
- Monitor database performance with >100 emails/day
- Consider connection pooling for high volumes
- Implement cleanup job for old processed emails

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented**:
- TLS/SSL encryption for IMAP connection
- App-specific password support
- Sender whitelist filtering
- Environment variable for credentials
- No credentials in code or logs

⚠️ **User Responsibility**:
- Keep credentials secure
- Use app-specific passwords
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Monitor for suspicious emails
- Review data retention policies

## Monitoring

### Log Messages to Watch

**Success**:
```
INFO  [email] Email connection test successful
INFO  [email-processor] Email processor started with interval: 5m0s
INFO  [email-processor] Fetched 3 new emails
INFO  [email-processor] Stored email: "Subject" from sender@example.com
INFO  [email-processor] Created article 123 from email 456
```

**Warnings**:
```
WARN  [email] Email connection test failed
WARN  [email-processor] Failed to mark message as read
WARN  [email] Skipping email from non-allowed sender
```

**Errors**:
```
ERROR [email] Failed to fetch emails: connection timeout
ERROR [email-processor] Failed to process email 123 into article
ERROR [email-processor] Retry failed for email 123
```

### Metrics to Track
- Total emails received
- Emails processed successfully
- Pending/unprocessed emails
- Failed emails by error type
- Processing time per email
- Articles created from emails

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

1. **Check email integration status**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       COUNT(*) as total,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE processed) as processed,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE NOT processed) as pending,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE error IS NOT NULL) as failed
   FROM emails;
   ```

2. **View recent errors**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, sender, subject, error, retry_count, received_date
   FROM emails
   WHERE error IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY received_date DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Check logs**:
   Look for `[email]` and `[email-processor]` tags

### Common Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Connection fails | Check credentials, use app password |
| No emails processed | Verify sender in allowed list |
| Duplicate processing | Check message_id unique constraint |
| Processing errors | Check logs, retry_count, error column |
